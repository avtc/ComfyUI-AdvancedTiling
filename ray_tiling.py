"""
Raylight integration for DiT tiling.

Provides AdvancedTilingRay node that works with raylight's RAY_ACTORS type,
applying toroidal attention tiling on distributed workers.

Uses manual Ray remote calls instead of @ray_patch to avoid serialization
issues with custom node packages that have non-standard import paths
(e.g. hyphens in directory names that prevent normal Python imports).
